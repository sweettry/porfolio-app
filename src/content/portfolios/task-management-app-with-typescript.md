The full-stack task management application, built using TypeScript enables users to efficiently create and manage tasks, set priorities, and handle task statuses. A key challenge faced during development was synchronizing the server state with real-time task counters, which was successfully resolved by implementing a combination of React Query and Context API, resulting in a smooth user experience. This project showcases proficiency in using TypeScript alongside a variety of front-end and back-end technologies while offering a user-friendly interface for task management and effectively synchronizing server state for real-time updates.
