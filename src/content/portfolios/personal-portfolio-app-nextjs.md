The personal portfolio app is a Next.js and TypeScript-based project that showcases the work without requiring third-party dependencies such as databases or content management systems. Built from scratch, it features a custom design with content stored in markdown files and includes an intuitive search functionality. One challenge faced during the development was efficiently fetching and parsing local data stored in markdown files. The solution involved using the Node.js file system package to read and parse the content, allowing for seamless access and display within the app. The personal portfolio app successfully demonstrates the ability to create a server-side rendered application with Next.js and TypeScript, showcasing the my work in a clean and organized layout while providing a search feature for efficient navigation. The app is deployed on the Vercel platform, ensuring a fast and reliable hosting solution.
